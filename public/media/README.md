# Media Folder

Upload all your website media files here!

## File Structure

Place your files directly in this `media/` folder with these names:

- `headshot.png` - Your professional headshot photo
- `swim-team-podium.jpg` - Swim team podium photo
- `swim-1.jpg`, `swim-2.jpg`, `swim-3.jpg`, `swim-4.jpg` - Additional swim photos
- `swim-video.mp4` - Hero background video (optional)

## Note

The website is configured to look for images in the `public/` folder root, so after uploading here, you may need to move them to `public/` or update the image paths in the components.
